## Adaptation

By default, the SDLF manages the source code layer in the AWS service CodeCommit which allow to manage the artifacts and the team creations in a very efficient way. Unfortunately, in some cases, enterprise clients that wish to adopt the good practices of the SDLF already use another Source Control Management system. This can become a disadvantage when this company tries to use the SDLF. As [AWS Professional Service](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/) our goal is to keep adapting, improving and evolving the best offering for any framework in AWS, this is why we offer this improvement in order to delegate the source code layer and/or team repositories creation to be handled from an external tool.

Here you can find the documentation for every external tool:
